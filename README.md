language: python 3

Theory
1. data handling (variables & types)
variables act as containers for storing different data values. basic types include:
strings: text data like "Anu".
integers: whole numbers like 22.
floats: decimal numbers like 3.2.
booleans: logical True or False values.
typecasting: the process of manually converting one data type to another, such as turning a string into an integer to perform math.

2. user interaction & formatting
input: the input() function allows the program to take data from a user via the keyboard; note that it always returns data as a string.
f-strings: a modern way to format strings by embedding variables directly inside curly braces {}.
format specifiers: used to control how data is displayed, such as rounding decimals with :.2f or using zero padding to fill empty spaces.

3. logic & control flow
operators: used to compare values or combine conditions using and, or, and not.
if statements: blocks of code that only run if a specific condition is met.
ternary operator: a compact, one-line version of an if-else block.

4. loops (iteration)
for loops: used to iterate over a specific range or a sequence like a string.
while loops: used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true.
nested loops: placing one loop inside another, often used to create grids or patterns.

5. data collections
python offers different ways to store groups of items:
lists: ordered and changeable; they allow duplicate items.
sets: unordered and unique; they automatically remove any duplicate values.
tuples: ordered but "locked" (immutable); once created, their contents cannot be changed.

conclusion
this project successfully covers the fundamental building blocks of python, from basic variable assignment to complex nested loops and data structures. mastering these basics provides the necessary foundation for moving into advanced topics like object-oriented programming (oop) or data science.
